# Old-School-Calculator
A fully functioning, 80's style solar-powered calculator using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS

A practice test of my CSS and JS skills, the CSS is written by myself, the design based on the solar-powered calculators used back in the 1980s. It was pretty fun to design and I was happy with my CSS abilities at the time.  

The Javascript was a bit more challenging than my off-the-top-of-my-head skills at the time, so it is a combination of parts of different tutorials, which I adapted to the needs of this project. The finishing touch was to make the Memory buttons work, which I happily surprised myself by doing without detailed help.

Overall, I am happy with the results and very happy to have continued my learning journey!

# Old-School-Calculator
A fully functioning, 80's style solar-powered calculator using HTML, CSS, OOP JavaScript.

A practice test of my CSS and JS skills, the CSS is written by myself, and the design is based on the solar-powered calculators used back in the 1980s (when we weren't allowed to use calculators in school, so they were wicked cool to have). Using pseudo-classes, creative shadows and gradients, it was pretty fun to design and I was happy with my CSS abilities at the time.  

I was fairly new to constructor classes at the time, so the Javascript began with a few different calculator tutorials, which I took the basics from and adapted to the needs of this project. On my own, I added the Power On, Modulo, Squareroot, Memory Recall, Memory Clear, Memory Plus and Memory Minus functionality.

Overall, I am happy with the results and very happy to have continued my learning journey! Thanks for checking it out!
